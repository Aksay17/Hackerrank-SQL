If you are writing each domain solution in one `.sql` file, you can modify the README file as follows:

# HackerRank SQL Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to SQL questions on HackerRank. The solutions are organized by problem domains corresponding to the different categories on HackerRank.
The purpose of creating this repositiory is to revise my SQL basics whenever needed :)

## Problem Domains

- Basic Select
- Aggregation
- Join
- Subquery
- String
- Advanced
- Alternative Queries

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
|-- Select
|   |-- select_solution.sql
|-- Aggregation
|   |-- aggregation_solution.sql
|-- Join
|   |-- join_solution.sql
|-- Subquery
|   |-- subquery_solution.sql
|-- String
|   |-- string_solution.sql
|-- Advanced
|   |-- advanced_solution.sql
|-- Alternative Queries
|   |-- alternative_queries_solution.sql
|-- README.md
```

## How to Use

Each problem domain folder contains a single SQL file named `domain_solution.sql`, representing the solution to the corresponding category of problems. You can review the SQL code in these files to understand the logic behind the solutions.

Feel free to clone or download this repository and use the solutions as a reference while solving the HackerRank SQL questions. However, it's highly recommended to attempt the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Notes

- The solutions provided here are my own implementations and may not be the most optimal or efficient solutions.
- Make sure to test the solutions on the HackerRank platform to ensure their correctness and accuracy.
- Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative solutions via pull requests.

Happy coding!
